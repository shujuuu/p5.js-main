# Adding inline documentation to p5.js

By adding inline documentation in the p5.js source code, a reference can be automatically generated. This document outlines the tags and information to include in your documentation so that it shows up in the reference, formatted properly. The reference is auto-generated from the source code periodically, so it may take a few days for your documentation to show up in the reference. If it's been longer than a few days or you're having other problems email [hello@p5js.org](mailto:hello@p5js.org).

See below for the basics, more specifics about yuidoc style [here](http://yui.github.io/yuidoc/syntax/index.html). __Please limit line length to 80 columns, starting new lines when it runs over.__

__[List of examples needed](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/2865) (you can also view the most up to date list by building the library with grunt and looking at the log messages)__

## Specify element type and description

There are 4 kinds of elements: `@class`, `@method`, `@property`, `@event`.
You must specify one of these for the element to appear in the docs, with the name of the element after it. The description should appear on top. A few formatting tips:
* You can use markdown syntax to format the description text. 
* Any function, variable, or constant name should be `monospaced` by using single quotes on either side.
* Double line breaks are recognized as new paragraphs. You do not need to insert `<br><br>` tags.
* When possible, link to other files when mentioning other function or variable names. For example, you can see the preload method linked in the description for [loadImage](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/src/image/loading_displaying.js#L21).
* Here is [yuidoc's reference](http://yui.github.io/yuidoc/syntax/index.html#basic-requirements) for more syntax information.

```js
   /**
    * The x component of the vector
    * @property x
    * @type {Number}
    */
    this.x = x || 0;
```

```js

  /**
   * Draw an arc
   *
   * If x, y, width, height, start and stop are the only params provided, draws an
   * open pie.
   * If mode is provided draws the arc either open, chord or pie, dependant
   * on the variable provided
   *
   * @param  {Number} x x-coordinate of the arc's ellipse
   * @param  {Number} y y-coordinate of the arc's ellipse
   * @param  {Number} width width of the arc's ellipse by default
   * @param  {Number} height height of the arc's ellipse by default
   * @param  {Number} start angle to start the arc, specified in radians
   * @param  {Number} stop angle to stop the arc, specified in radians
   * @param  {String} [mode] optional parameter to determine the way of drawing the arc
   */
```

```js
  /**
   *
   * Calculates the magnitude (length) of the vector and returns the result
   * as a float (this is simply the equation <em>sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z)</em>.)
   *
   * @method mag
   * @return {number} magnitude (length) of the vector
   */
   PVector.prototype.mag = function () {
    return Math.sqrt(this.magSq());
   };
```

## Specify parameters

For methods, any `@params` should be specified. They should not be formatted with spaces, tabs, etc, and should follow the standard:

```
@param {type} name Description here, no problem how long.
```

If the parameter is optional, add square brackets around the name:

```
@param {type} [name] Description here.
```

If the parameter takes one or more values defined in [`constants.js`](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/src/core/constants.js) ,
then the type should be specified as `{Constant}` and the valid values should be enumerated in the comment following the `either` keyword, eg:

```
@param {Constant} horizAlign horizontal alignment, either LEFT, CENTER, or RIGHT
```

## Specify return type

The `@return` is identical to `@params`, but without the name. It should be the last element in `@method`. The JS types are: String, Number, Boolean, Object, Array, Null, and Undefined. If there is no return type, do not include `@return`. 

```
@return {type} Description of the data returned.
```

If the method returns the parent object, you can skip the `@return` and add this line instead:

```
@chainable
```

## Additional signatures

If a method has multiple possible parameter options, you can specify each individually. For example, see the examples for [background](http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/background) under "syntax". To do this, choose one version to list as the first signature using the guidelines above. At the end of the documentation block, you can add additional signatures, each in its own block, following the example below.

```js
/**
 * @method background
 * @param {String} colorstring color string, possible formats include: integer
 *                         rgb() or rgba(), percentage rgb() or rgba(),
 *                         3-digit hex, 6-digit hex
 * @param {Number} [a] alpha value
 */

/**
 * @method background
 * @param {Number} gray specifies a value between white and black
 * @param {Number} [a]
 */
```

Notes:
* If a parameter was given description previously, like `a` in this case, you do not need to rewrite its description again. 
* It is not necessary to create a separate signature if the only difference between two signatures is the addition of an optional parameter.
* You can see two examples of this inline in the source code for [background](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/f38f91308fdacc2f1982e0430b620778fff30a5a/src/color/setting.js#L106) and [color](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/f38f91308fdacc2f1982e0430b620778fff30a5a/src/color/creating_reading.js#L241).

## Specify other tags

Use `@final` if a property or variable is a constant:

```js
    /**
     * PI is a mathematical constant with the value 3.14159265358979323846.
     * @property PI
     * @type Number
     * @final
     */
    PI: PI
```

Use `@private` if a property or variable is a private variable (default is `@public` so no need to specify).

```js
    /**
     * _start calls preload() setup() and draw()
     * 
     * @method _start
     * @private
     */
     p5.prototype._start = function () {
```

## Specify module for files

The top of each *file* should contain a `@module` tag. Modules should correspond to JavaScript files (or require.js modules). They can work as groups in the lists of items. See [here](https://p5js.org/reference/#collection-list-nav) (the modules are COLOR, IMAGE, IO, PVECTOR, etc.). 

```js
/**
 * @module image
 */
define(function (require) {
  // code here
};
```


## Constructors

Constructors are defined with `@class`. Each constructor should have the tag `@class` followed by the name of the class, as well as the tag `@constructor`, and any `@param` tags required.

```js
  /**
   * The p5 constructor function.
   * @class p5
   * @constructor
   * @param {Object} [node] The canvas element. A canvas will be added to the DOM if not provided.
   * @param {Object} [sketch] The sketch object.
   */
   const p5 = function(node, sketch) {
     ...
   }
```

## Adding code samples

You can add code samples with `@example`. Code samples should be placed between `<code></code>` tags with comments included. Please review the [documentation style guide](./documentation_style_guide.md) for more information on style.

Unless otherwise specified with a `setup()` function, each `<code>` block is automatically run on a canvas of 100x100 pixels with a gray background. If your code sample creates other HTML elements apart from the canvas, they will be rendered with a width of 100 pixels.

```
@example
<div>
<code>
arc(50, 55, 50, 50, 0, HALF_PI);
noFill();
arc(50, 55, 60, 60, HALF_PI, PI);
arc(50, 55, 70, 70, PI, PI + QUARTER_PI);
arc(50, 55, 80, 80, PI + QUARTER_PI, TWO_PI);
describe('A shattered outline of an ellipse created using four arcs.');
</code>
</div>
```

You can have multiple examples for one function, just make sure you have only
one `@example` followed by each example having its own `<div>` wrapping separated
by a line break. 

```
@example
<div>
<code>
arc(50, 50, 80, 80, 0, PI + QUARTER_PI, OPEN);
describe('An ellipse created using an arc with its top right open.');
</code>
</div>

<div>
<code>
arc(50, 50, 80, 80, 0, PI, OPEN);
describe('The bottom half of an ellipse created using arc.');
</code>
</div>
```

If you do not want the example to execute your code (i.e. you just want the code to show up), include the class `"norender"` in the `<div>`:
```
@example
<div class="norender">
<code>
arc(50, 50, 80, 80, 0, PI + QUARTER_PI, OPEN);
describe('ellipse created using arc with its top right open');
</code>
</div>
```

If you do not want the example to be run as part of the build tests (for example, if the example requires user interaction, or uses functionality not supported by the headless-Chrome test framework), include the class `"notest"` in the `<div>`:

```
@example
<div class='norender notest'><code>
function setup() {
  let c = createCanvas(100, 100);
  saveCanvas(c, 'myCanvas', 'jpg');
}
</code></div>
```

If you need to link to external asset files, put them in [/docs/yuidoc-p5-theme/assets](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/tree/main/docs/yuidoc-p5-theme/assets) and then link to them with "assets/filename.ext" in the code. See the [tint example](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/tint).

### Add a canvas description using describe()
Finally, for every example you add, you are required to use the p5.js function `describe()` in the example to create a screen-reader accessible description for the canvas. Include only one parameter: a string with a brief description of what is happening on the canvas. Do NOT add a second parameter.
```
@example
<div>
<code>
let xoff = 0.0;
function draw() {
  background(204);
  xoff = xoff + 0.01;
  let n = noise(xoff) * width;
  line(n, 0, n, height);
  decribe('A vertical line moves randomly from left to right.');
}
</code>
</div>

<div>
<code>
let noiseScale = 0.02;
function draw() {
  background(0);
  for (let x = 0; x < width; x += 1) {
    let noiseVal = noise((mouseX + x) * noiseScale, mouseY * noiseScale);
    stroke(noiseVal*255);
    line(x, mouseY + noiseVal * 80, x, height);
  }
  describe('A horizontal wave pattern moves in the opposite direction of the mouse.');
}
</code>
</div>

```
For more on `describe()` visit the [web accessibility contributor docs](https://p5js.org/contributor-docs/#/web_accessibility?id=user-generated-accessible-canvas-descriptions).

Previous documentation guidelines required adding [alt-text](https://moz.com/learn/seo/alt-text) to create screen-reader accessible canvas description. THIS IS NO LONGER RECOMMENDED. ALWAYS USE `describe()`. Previously, alt-text was added with the tag `@alt` at the end of all of the examples for a given function (not an individual `@alt` tag under each), and an added a line break to separate the descriptions for multiple examples. 
```
@example
<div>
<code>
let xoff = 0.0;
function draw() {
  background(204);
  xoff = xoff + 0.01;
  let n = noise(xoff) * width;
  line(n, 0, n, height);
}
</code>
</div>

<div>
<code>
let noiseScale = 0.02;
function draw() {
  background(0);
  for (let x = 0; x < width; x += 1) {
    let noiseVal = noise((mouseX + x) * noiseScale, mouseY * noiseScale);
    stroke(noiseVal * 255);
    line(x, mouseY + noiseVal * 80, x, height);
  }
}
</code>
</div>

@alt
vertical line moves left to right with updating noise values.
horizontal wave pattern effected by mouse x-position & updating noise values.
```

## Template for methods
Here is an example for a well-documented method. To create a new method, you can use [this template](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/tree/main/contributor_docs/method.example.js). Replace the text with your method's variables and remove the remaining ones.

## Generating documentation

* Run `npm run docs` once first to generate all local files needed, as well as a copy of the reference from the source code. Run it again anytime you make changes to the core JS files behind the yuidoc reference page. These are changes in files located in the yuidoc-p5-theme folder, NOT inline documentation changes to src.
* If you only made changes to the source code, you can just run `npm run grunt yui`, though `npm run grunt yui:build` will also do the trick. 
* You can run `npm run docs:dev` to launch a live preview of the site that will update each time you make changes. (You will need to refresh the page after making changes to see them appear.)

The build reference can be found in docs/reference. To preview it locally, run `npm run grunt yui:dev` and view it as http://localhost:9001/docs/reference/.


## Spanish language version

The [Spanish version](http://p5js.org/es/reference) is created a little differently. Here are [instructions](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/blob/main/contributor_docs/i18n_contribution.md) to update this material.
